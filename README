I moved to using Linux full-time in August 2024. 

My primary system before hand was MacOS and I have been moving files to a 60TB Raid managed by my Linux system.

MacOS leaves junk behind and I used to use Hazel to organize files. No good way to do that on Linux, so I just started building my own tools. These are my tools.
